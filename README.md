# SimpleCalculator-
This repository will document my progress with learning Assembly for X86 Intel architecture. I will be making a simple calculator, which will be my first project in assembly, with difficulty level being "Beginner". This will build the fundamental skills I will need to begin developing more advanced software in asm, such as a device driver!
